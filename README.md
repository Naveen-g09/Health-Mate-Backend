# Health-Mate-Backend

## Description
Health-Mate-Backend is a Node.js backend application integrated with MongoDB and Google API. It was created during a hackathon to complement a React Native frontend application called Health Mate, developed in Expo. This backend facilitates CRUD operations where the frontend sends user location coordinates and range, and the backend processes the data to provide a list of nearby doctors, clinics, or hospitals requested by the user.
